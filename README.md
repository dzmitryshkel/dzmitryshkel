## ðŸš€ About me

My name is Dzmitry Shkel, Iâ€™m 21 yo and Iâ€™m a novice QA engineer who has successfully completed Software Testing Course with A1QA and already have month+ experience as QA trainee. I am striving to apply my skills and experience to obtain a position of a QA assurance engineer. 
I'm proud that I was expelled from university because of my opposition position against the illegitimate president lukashenko and moved to Kyiv in Ukraine and found my first QA trainee position there.
However, the war there forced me to flee again. Now Im locating in Wroclaw, Poland.
I also:
1. Scrupulous (was the head of my university group in MITSO (Minsk, Belarus)
2. Persistent and result-driven 
3. Robust communicative skills (able to build rapport with peers and customers and effectively reach agreement)
4. A great team player 
5. Flexible (worked in shifts, adapted to different workloads and kept up with ongoing updates)
6. A fast learner 
7. Curious and open to new information (follow trends, read a lot, young:)
